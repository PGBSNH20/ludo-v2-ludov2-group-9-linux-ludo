-# Asynchronous communication
-All communication between clients and the game server is done using the [SignalR](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/signalr) framework.</br>
-Messages are sent back-and-forth between users and the server through the [MessagePack protocol](https://msgpack.org/).</br>
-The reason for using this protocol over the default **JSON** is speed (latency).</br>
-This also equates to lesser bandwidth which is always a plus if possible.
-
-The MessagePack protocol works by serializing the data into byte-arrays which are then de-serialized upon arrival.
-# SignalR infrastructure
-The SignalR framework works by receiving/sending data through **hubs**.</br>
-Instead of creating individual hubs for each game there is only one [hub](https://github.com/PGBSNH20/ludo-v2-ludov2-group-9-linux-ludo/blob/main/src/LinuxLudo.Web/Hubs/HubController.cs) in the game which handles all traffic, across **all** games & users.</br>
-
-The hub then splits its users up into groups which are correlated to the game's **UUID**.
-
-**Note:** there are no unit tests as regards to the hub currently in the project due to problems with mocking a hub client connection.
-In order to fully test and simulate a connection every user must provide a **ConnectionId** from its context.
-As of right now (05/28) the lack of underlying documentation restricts us from mock said information, but will be added if a solution appears.
-The hubs core logic is still tested through the [GameEngineTest](https://github.com/PGBSNH20/ludo-v2-ludov2-group-9-linux-ludo/blob/main/src/LinuxLudo.Test/Game/GameEngineTest.cs).
-
-# GameHub methods
-The player's turn is updated through UpdatePlayerTurn() after any of the following methods have executed fully:
-- MoveToken()
-- BringOutToken()
-
-The hub controlling the games use the following methods:
-
-## JoinGame
-```csharp
-public async Task JoinGame(string username, Guid gameId)
-```
-Called whenever a user clicks the join button on a game page.
-Responsible for adding the user to the specified games group </br>
-by fetching 
-```csharp 
-Context.ConnectionId
-```
-and storing it in the **hubs** repository list of connected users.
-
-## NotifyRollDice
-```csharp
-public async Task NotifyRollDice(string username, int roll)
-```
-A helper method used to notify connected clients that a player has rolled the dice.
-
-## MoveToken
-```csharp
-public async Task MoveToken(byte[] receivedMessage)
-```
-Called when the player whose turn it is click the roll dice button.
-Responsible for calculating the updated tokens position and almost broadcasting the change to connected clients through **NotifyRollDice()**
-It is also responsible for determining what (if any) tokens have been knocked out and also as a result if a player has won.
-It does this by analyzing the result of the [GameEngine](https://github.com/PGBSNH20/ludo-v2-ludov2-group-9-linux-ludo/blob/main/src/LinuxLudo.API/Domain/GameEngine.cs)'s **MoveToken()** method.
-
-## BringOutToken
-```csharp
-public async Task BringOutToken(byte[] receivedMessage)
-```
-Called when a player clicks the bring out token button.
-Responsible for rolling the dice and analyzing the result and determining whether or not the player brings out a token (roll number 6).
-It then either broadcasts a successful token "bring-out" or simply the rolled number.
-
-## NotifyTokenKnockout
-```csharp
-public async Task NotifyTokenKnockout(string tokenHolderName, char tokenIdentifierChar)
-```
-A helper method used to notify connected clients on which token has been knocked out (the players name holding the token and the tokens identifier letter).
-
-## UpdatePlayerTurn
-```csharp
-private async Task UpdatePlayerTurn(OpenGame game)
-```
-A helper method used to notify connected clients on whose turn it is. Sends the color of whose turn it is.
-Called after any full execution from:
-- MoveToken()
-- BringOutToken()
-
-## SendConnectionChanged
-```csharp
-private async Task SendConnectionChanged(string gameId, string username, List<Player> players)
-```
-Called whenever a player connects/disconnects from the game.
-Used to notify clients of whoever joined/leaved and also sends an updated list of **connected** players.
-
-## OnDisconnectedAsync
-```csharp
-public override async Task OnDisconnectedAsync(Exception exception)
-```
-Called internally from SignalR whenever a connected client disconnects for **any** reason.
-This **overridden** method automatically removes the disconnected player from its **game**.
-Subsequently it notifies the **connected** clients the name of the disconnected player and then updates the game's turn
-if the game's current turn was set to the **disconnected** player.

-# Authentication
-Authentication on the website is **optional** and is **not** required to play a game. Users may play as **guests** with a custom inputted name or choose to login to their accounts.</br>
-
-All authentication based actions (logging in/signing up/verifiying users) is done through our own back-end. There are no third-party **services** that are being used, excluding frameworks/libraries et.c.</br>
-
-The main component responsible for executing these actions is the [AuthController](https://github.com/PGBSNH20/ludo-v2-ludov2-group-9-linux-ludo/blob/main/src/LinuxLudo.API/Controllers/AuthController.cs).
-It is structured as seen below.
-
-# AuthController
-- ## SignUp
-```csharp
-[HttpPost("SignUp")]
-        public async Task<IActionResult> SignUp([FromBody] SignUpResource resource)
-```
-This method handles the signup requests.
-It does so by taking an input **resource** as username/password and then it runs queries through our database.
-It then returns a response message, verifying of its potential success, and/or response codes/message.
-
-- ## SignIn
-```csharp
-[HttpPost("SignIn")]
-        public async Task<IActionResult> SignIn([FromBody] SignInResource resource)
-```
-Responsible for signing in and verifying user details.
-This method works similarly to SignUp, but rather than creating new entries in the database, it **verifies** them.
-If the login request is valid (user credentials match database) an **JWT** authentication token is sent back, along with a success code/message.
-If for some reason the request wasn't valid, explicit details are sent back to the client explaining what the issue is.

-# Deployment
-
-To the deploy our application, we planned to use docker cotnainers to deploy, and we succeded before a big merge was merged.
-To deploy the application goto [Commit](https://github.com/PGBSNH20/ludo-v2-ludov2-group-9-linux-ludo/tree/963378a28b5d59c2b603c9cd7ca21976cb258ddb) and clone.
-Go into the root folder and run `ocker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up` this will deploy a "development" version o the app.
-
-To deploy for production please copy `docker/docker-compose.prod.yml` and create a `.env` from `.env.example`, after that run `docker-compose up -d`.
-
-To make our deployments better we had thoughts about using github actions to automate the builds, which would save alot of time and make it possible for dynamic updates.
-
-In the current state the main branch is unstable.
-
-Deployed on [ludo.nerdyhamster.net](https://ludo.nerdyhamster.net)

-# Frontend responsive design
-Our goal with the website layout & elements was to provide full-responsiveness regardless of screen size and device. This is something that can vary a lot in difficulty depending on what type of element you're dealing with.
-Buttons, text, and other **GUI** elements are rather easy to scale and adjust based on underlying client-side parameters such as screen-size. </br>
-
-This is something we've done quite easily in a lot of places by using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) as our CSS-library of choice.
-By using Tailwind we can easily design our elements by dividing them up into rows/columns and appyling all the neccessary design adjustments right inside the HTML.
-
-# The canvas
-Our main source of attention is derived from the canvas where the actual game is rendered and displayed.</br>
-The problem with the canvas and **responsive-design** comes from its rendering nature, **relational** sizing. By relational sizing, I mean the size of all objects inside of the canvas are relative to one another.
-For example (not actual sizing), say the canvas is 100px wide, and therefore 100px tall. A token's width might then be 1/20 of the canvas width, as its relative to everything surronding it.
-And this goes on and on, font-sizes for example might be 1/100 of the canvas width, and so if the canvas gets bigger, so does the font-size.
-
-This brings us to the **problem** at hand: the canvas width must be **equal** to the height, a 1:1 aspect ratio. Seeing as most devices don't have a 1:1 ratio, but rather most commonly 16:9.</br>
-So to combat this the canvas scales semi-responsively, on larger screens it sets itself to a high percentage of the total page area, and on mobile screens it fits as big as possible to combat the smaller screen.
